    <img src="../images/soychicken.jpg">
    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>A delicious, fast, and easy recipe for any week night dinner. 
    The chicken comes out flavorful with a sweet and tangy glaze. Serve with rice and steamed snow peas for a complete meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>5 pounds bone-in chicken thighs with skin</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sugar, soy sauce, water, garlic, and ginger in a large stock pot; stir until sugar is dissolved.
        Place chicken in stock pot and bring to a boil.
        Using tongs, turn chicken in pot every 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Boil chicken until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 35 minutes.
         An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
         Sauce mixture will turn into a rich, brown glaze. Remove pot from heat and let cool 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on a platter and sprinkle with chopped green onions.</li>
    </ol>
