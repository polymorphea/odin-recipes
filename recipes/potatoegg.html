    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large baking potato, peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>6 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat.
        Spread potato slices across bottom of the pan and cook, turning once,
        until golden on both sides. Remove slices from pan and drain.</li>
        <li>When all potato slices have been cooked,
         return them to the pan. Turn heat to high.
         Pour on the beaten eggs and season with salt and pepper.
         Tilt the pan so that the eggs flow to the bottom of the pan.
         Turn heat to medium low. Cover pan with a plate and flip pan so that frittata is turned out onto plate.
         Slide the frittata back into the pan with the uncooked side down. Cover and let cook another 2 minutes.

        <li>When frittata is finished cooking, remove it from the pan and drain briefly on paper towels before serving.</li>
